In the past 3 years, we have seen a flurry of publications on single-cell RNA sequencing
         (RNA-seq) analyses of pancreatic islets from mouse and human. This technology holds
         the promise to refine cell-type signatures and discover cellular heterogeneity among
         the canonical endocrine cell types such as the glucagon-producing alpha and insulin-producing
         beta cells, going as far as suggesting new subtypes. In addition, single-cell RNA-seq
         has the ability to characterize rare endocrine cell types that are not captured by
         prior bulk analysis. With transcriptomics data from individual endocrine cells, cellular
         states can be profiled both along developmental processes and during the emergence
         of metabolic diseases. However, the promises of this new technology have not yet been
         met in full. While the methodology for the first time enabled the transcriptional
         definition of rare endocrine cell types such as ghrelin-producing epsilon cells, some of
         the conclusions regarding cell-type-specific gene expression changes in type 2 diabetes
         might need to be revisited once larger sample sizes become available. Data generation
         and analysis are continuously improving single-cell RNA-seq approaches and are helping
         us to understand the (mal)adaptations of the islet cells during development, metabolic
         challenge, and disease.
